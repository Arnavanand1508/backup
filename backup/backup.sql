Science, it can be undoubtedly said, is the very soul of food safety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Food safety is not a matter of theory or tradition; it is a discipline rooted in facts, research, and continuous innovation. The global landscape of food safety is constantly evolving, driven by new scientific discoveries, emerging foodborne hazards, and advancements in food production. This year, the World Health Organisation has given an opportunity to acknowledge how science, technology, and innovation are shaping a new era of food safety globally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Science is involved in every step of food safety, beginning with the setting of standards. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India has a Scientific Committee and 21 Scientific Panels that are its principal scientific arms in the standards development process. The authority has empanelled 286 scientific experts from 88 different scientific organisations and various institutes working in the area of food safety and nutrition. Till date, standards for 1,349 food products, 300 additives and 300 processing aids have been notified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The last decade has witnessed transformative advancements in India&rsquo;s food safety landscape, all powered by scientific innovation. We have embraced cutting-edge technologies like food irradiation, a process proven to enhance food safety and extend shelf-life by eliminating harmful pathogens and pests. The development of high-yielding food products and the pioneering efforts in biofortification are further testaments to our scientific prowess, addressing both food security and nutritional deficiencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A landmark moment in this journey was the release 109 high yielding, climate resilient and biofortified varieties of crops by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in August, 2024, at the India Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi. Out of 109 varieties, 23 varieties were released as biofortified crops (rich in zinc, iron, protein etc).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Addressing an eminent gathering of food regulators and experts from around the world at the Global Food Regulators Summit held in September 2024, Hon&rsquo;ble Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare Shri JP Nadda underlined the growing importance of food regulators at a time when world is faced with challenges like foodborne illnesses, nutraceutical safety, novel foods, and micro plastics, all the while striving for sustainability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He had also emphasized the need for continuous collaboration, relentless innovation, and a commitment to constant improvement in the food safety systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>India&rsquo;s promotion of millets as &ldquo;Nutri-cereals&rdquo; has gained global recognition. Being the largest producers of millets in the World (17.3 million tons in 2022-23), India developed standards for 13 varieties of millets which were well appreciated and acknowledged by Codex-Alimantarious Commission (represents FAO and WHO) in December 2023. Our efforts have not only revitalized these traditional grains domestically but have also spotlighted their nutritional value on the world stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Food safety is not a matter of choice; it is a foundational element of public health. Every year, an estimated 600 million people&mdash;nearly one in every ten&mdash;fall ill from consuming contaminated food, and around 420,000 of them die, as per WHO. Children under the age of five bear a disproportionate burden of these stark figures, accounting for 40% of foodborne diseases and approximately 125,000 deaths annually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In today&rsquo;s complex and globally interlinked food systems, ensuring food safety at every stage&mdash;from farm to fork&mdash;is paramount. This requires the combined power of science-based risk assessments and standards, rapid detection tools, and emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), digitization, and smart packaging. These innovations are no longer futuristic ideas; they are already driving real-time decisions and transformative practices on the ground, globally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Artificial intelligence has emerged as a transformative tool in addressing the multifaceted challenges of food safety, food quality, and food security. AI enhances food safety through real-time contamination detection, predictive risk modelling, and compliance monitoring, reducing public health risks. It improves food quality by automating defect detection, optimizing shelf-life predictions, and ensuring consistency in taste, texture, and appearance. In addition, AI addresses food security by enabling resource-efficient agriculture, yield forecasting, and supply chain optimization to ensure the availability and accessibility of nutritious food resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The integration of AI with advanced food processing techniques&mdash;such as high-pressure processing, ultraviolet treatment, pulsed electric fields, cold plasma, and irradiation&mdash;ensures</p>\r\n\r\n<p>microbial safety, extends shelf life, and enhances product quality. Furthermore, the convergence of AI with emerging technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, and AI-powered sensors enables proactive risk management, predictive analytics, and automated quality control throughout the food supply chain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New technology is also being encouraged to find alternatives to plastic in food packaging, to reduce the dependence on plastics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent years, significant innovations and trends have emerged in the field of food product testing, transforming the way food is produced, processed, and consumed. These advancements have improved the efficiency, accuracy, and effectiveness of food safety measures, enabling early detection of foodborne illnesses and preventing widespread outbreaks. As global population rise, food product testing has become increasingly crucial in detecting contaminants, preventing foodborne illnesses and ensuring regulatory compliance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The global food safety testing market is fast growing valuing at US$ 21.24 billion in 2024 and expected to reach US$ 44.76 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 8.63% during the forecast period 2025&ndash;2033.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To enhance food safety testing systems, various countries are implementing emerging technologies as these are increasingly augmenting the capabilities of traditional food safety systems. Traditional techniques have become unsuitable for direct application in the premises of food businesses as they are relatively expensive, time-consuming and labour intensive, impeding their use as point-of-need tests or rapid tests. In addition, accessibility to such high-end analytical techniques is limited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emerging techniques like Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) combined with powerful bioinformatic approaches are revolutionising food microbiology. It has transformed from being solely a research tool to becoming routinely applied in many fields including diagnostics, outbreak investigations, antimicrobial resistance, forensics and food. The technology is developing at a rapid pace, with continuous improvement in quality and cost reduction and is having a major influence on food microbiology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smart bio-systems has also introduced a revolutionary approach to food quality monitoring. Advanced biosensors, biopolymers and digital technologies has created intelligent solutions capable of real-time, on-site detection of food quality parameters, monitoring a wide range of factors like microbial contamination, chemical residues, nutrient levels, and freshness indicators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In India, there is a high demand for cost-effective and robust analytical devices/kits for food safety monitoring in remote areas in order to create effective prevention and control strategies. Thus, India is encouraging the use of rapid food testing kits/equipment/methods benefitting the food industry and surveillance activities in the country. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has established a mechanism for approval of rapid food testing kits/equipment/methods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Countries like India, the USA, and Japan use advanced labelling technologies to enhance food safety, but their approaches differ in scale and sophistication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>India is expanding the use of QR codes, mobile apps, and starting to explore blockchain and smart packaging. The USA has advanced systems with widespread use of QR codes, RFID, blockchain, and smart labels, backed by strong regulatory enforcement and high consumer demand for traceability. Japan leads in high-tech integration, using blockchain, smart packaging, and detailed traceability systems in everyday retail, with strong consumer engagement and consistent implementation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Integration of smart technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) into food packaging is not only improving food safety but also plays a crucial role in reducing food waste, a major global issue. Techniques like Smart Packaging Technologies (Use of embedded sensors, time-temperature indicators (TTIs), and color-changing labels to monitor spoilage, temperature abuse, and packaging integrity), Anti-Counterfeit measures to ensure authenticity, Machine learning for Predictive Shelf Life &amp; Material Optimization, Robotics for accurate sealing, filling, and defect detection are significantly used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>India is progressively trying to advance towards technology-driven and consumer-centric regulatory frameworks to enhance food safety standards by integrating digital tools, such as QR codes and blockchain, for improved traceability and transparency across the food supply chain despite the economic and social challenges. FSSAI is actively promoting the use of smart labelling, mobile applications, and real-time monitoring systems to empower consumers with accurate information and enable quicker identification of food safety issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>India is investing in modernizing laboratory infrastructure and adopting advanced testing technologies to ensure compliance with both domestic and international standards. These efforts reflect a growing emphasis on leveraging technology and prioritizing consumer awareness to build trust and ensure the safety and quality of food products nationwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Providing healthy and nutritionally rich food in sufficient quantities is a major United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) to end hunger by 2030. Bio fortification addresses the challenge of Micronutrient Deficiencies (&lsquo;Hidden Hunger) by increasing the nutrient density of staple crops that form the basis of these diets, thereby improving nutritional status without requiring significant changes in dietary habits or food availability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This World Food Safety Day, let us commit to harnessing the full power of &lsquo;Science in Action&rsquo; to safeguard the health and well-being of every citizen, ensuring that food truly serves as our medicine, building a robust, resilient, and safe food system for generations to come.</p>	blog_images/Khet_se.png	Shri G.

2	How to Have a Vigil on Ultra Processed Foods	Glad to share my views about the Ultra Processed Foods – the issue of recent times cropping up and capturing the attention of the consumers.	<h3><strong>Glad to share my views about the Ultra Processed Foods</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The issue of recent times cropping up and capturing the attention of the consumers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Classification of Foods as per NOVA</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Before getting into the details, let us understand how the food items are classified based on the processing techniques. According to NOVA, a food classification system, foods and beverages are classified into four groups based on the extent and purpose of industrial processing:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Unprocessed and minimally processed foods</li>\r\n\t<li>Processed culinary ingredients</li>\r\n\t<li>Processed foods</li>\r\n\t<li>Ultra-processed foods</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>We know almost large quantity of the food items are processed to some extent, at least by preservation, so we cannot criticize the foods as being processed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Type I:</strong>&nbsp;Unprocessed or natural foods consumed in its original form such as fruit, leaves, stems, seeds, roots, muscle, eggs, milk. Minimally processed foods are again natural foods but altered by methods that help remove inedible or unwanted parts, through processes like drying, grinding, filtering, roasting, boiling, chilling, and freezing. These processes help preserve or extend the shelf life of food.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Type II:</strong>&nbsp;Processed culinary ingredients include oils, butter, sugar, and salt. These substances are derived from Type I category of foods by processes such as pressing, refining, grinding, milling, and drying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Type III:</strong>&nbsp;Processed Foods are industrial products made by adding salt, sugar or other substance found in Type 2 to Type 1 foods, using preservation methods which includes canned or bottled vegetables or legumes (pulses), some types of processed animal foods, freshly baked breads, and cheeses. The processing implies here to increase the longevity of Type 1 foods and make them more palatable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Type IV:</strong>&nbsp;Ultra-processed foods are formulations of ingredients, made by a series of industrial techniques and processes (hence &lsquo;ultra-processed&rsquo;).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They are typically energy-dense products, high in sugar, unhealthy fats, and salt, and low in dietary fibre, protein, vitamins, and minerals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The processes and the ingredients/additives used in the manufacturing of ultra-processed foods make them highly convenient, ready-to-eat, imperishable, hyperpalatable for consumers and highly profitable (low-cost ingredients, long shelf-life) for the manufacturers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its branding and ownership by transnational corporations, and aggressive marketing provides enormous market advantages for these foods over all other NOVA food groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Examples of Ultra-processed Foods</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Some common ultra-processed products are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Carbonated soft drinks</li>\r\n\t<li>Packaged sweet, fatty, or salty snacks</li>\r\n\t<li>candies (confectionery)</li>\r\n\t<li>Mass produced packaged breads and buns, cookies (biscuits), pastries, cakes and cake mixes</li>\r\n\t<li>Margarine and other spreads; sweetened breakfast &lsquo;cereals&rsquo; and fruit yoghurt and &lsquo;energy&rsquo; drinks</li>\r\n\t<li>Pre-prepared meat, cheese, pasta and pizza dishes</li>\r\n\t<li>Poultry and fish &lsquo;nuggets&rsquo; and &lsquo;sticks&rsquo;; sausages, burgers, hot dogs and other reconstituted meat products</li>\r\n\t<li>powdered and packaged &lsquo;instant&rsquo; soups, noodles and desserts &amp; many other types of product</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>How is it Different from a Normal Balanced Food?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Normal food contains balanced amount of required nutrients whereas HFSS foods/ultraprocessed foods contain less amounts of proteins, vitamins, phytochemicals, minerals, and dietary fiber but are rich in fat (especially saturated fatty acids), salt and sugar and high in calories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are typically nutritionally unbalanced and liable to be over-consumed. It also has a negative impact on health if consumed regularly or in excessive amounts. Few experimental studies stated that ultra-processed foods have high glycemic responses and low satiety potential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consumption of ultra-processed foods combined with poor physical activity has a meaningful relationship with NCDs such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How to identify that a food is Ultra processed Foods?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The presence of one or more food substances not used in kitchens or rare culinary use &amp; Presence of &ldquo;cosmetic additives&rdquo; can help to identify a product as ultra-processed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How did this shift from traditional to processed happen?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a universal shift from consumption of traditional home cooked food to more processed foods due to the following.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Rising income</li>\r\n\t<li>Increased purchasing power</li>\r\n\t<li>Urbanization &amp; Globalization of food trade</li>\r\n\t<li>Growth of the modern food sector &amp; Marketing strategies</li>\r\n\t<li>Changing consumer interests, food habits, food processes &amp; lifestyle</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Where are we now?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The processed food industry emerges as an important sector &amp; also vital for reducing food loss and to the shelf-life of agricultural produce. India was the third-largest retail market in the world. In the past, we focused on achieving food security, now on nutrition security. Studies have raised concerns related to the adverse health impact of ultra-processed foods and their correlation to growing cases of NCDs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How can we manage this?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Globally, countries have adopted policy interventions to promote healthy diets or reduce the consumption of unhealthy food such as</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Comprehensive nutrition policy</li>\r\n\t<li>Higher taxes on unhealthy food and lower taxes or subsidies/incentives for healthy food products</li>\r\n\t<li>Nutrition labelling for guiding consumers towards right purchases</li>\r\n\t<li>Awareness programmes</li>\r\n\t<li>Regulations on limiting advertising/marketing of ultra-processed foods</li>\r\n\t<li>Placing reasonable restrictions on marketing, especially to children on television and other media, like prohibiting junk food commercials between 6 am to 10 pm</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Key takeaways &ndash; Aware, Analyse &amp; Act</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Execution of such policies/programmes involves multiple stakeholders, including Policymakers, Food experts, Industry &amp; consumer bodies, NGOs, etc. It is a time intensive process. Let us hope for the same, but nonetheless as a responsible citizen, each one of us can teach one.</li>\r\n\t<li>It may be impossible to completely avoid/ devoid of this palatable/irresistible food, but we can train our tongue and consume it less frequently in moderation.</li>\r\n\t<li>Let us make it as a habit to relish occasionally with appropriate portion size/ control.</li>\r\n\t<li>Few studies have consistently revealed a strong relationship between health and happiness. Such a relationships are found to be more statistically robust than that between happiness and income.</li>\r\n\t<li>The most valuable thing that we can give to our family is staying fit &amp; being healthy. On par with the saying Charity begins at home, we can be the role model for the generation next, by imbibing healthy eating habits by bringing back the tradition and understanding the cultural value of our food systems.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Jointly we will spread the word, rebuild the Traditional Food Repository, and emphasize its importance.</p>	blog_images/Vigil.png	Dr. Kavitha Ramasamy	author_images/Dr._Kavitha_Ramasamy.jpg	Dr. Kavitha Ramasamy, Joint Director at FSSAI, holds a PhD in Food & Nutrition and works to ensure safe and healthy food for all through effective food standards and regulations.	2025-07-01
3	The Role of Forensic Serology in Food Forensics and Street Food Safety	Food forensics is an evolving discipline that applies scientific methods to ensure the authenticity, safety, and quality of food products.	<p>Food forensics is an evolving discipline that applies scientific methods to ensure the authenticity, safety, and quality of food products. As described in sources like Food Forensics: Techniques for Authenticity Determination of Food Products, various analytical tools are used to detect contamination, fraud, and adulteration in food. Among these, forensic serology&mdash;traditionally used in criminal investigations to identify biological fluids&mdash;has found valuable application in the food industry. It can be particularly useful in assessing the safety of both packaged foods and street-vended food, areas where food safety violations often go unnoticed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the context of food authenticity, forensic serology is used to identify traces of animal or human biological fluids such as blood, saliva, or other tissues. This can help detect the presence of undeclared animal products in vegetarian or religiously sensitive foods (e.g., halal or kosher). For instance, ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) and other serological tests can be employed to detect animal proteins, verifying whether a product labeled as &ldquo;100% vegetarian&rdquo; is indeed free from meat-based components. Similarly, it aids in the detection of species substitution in processed meats, where low-cost meats might be fraudulently labeled as premium products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Street food safety is an area where forensic serology becomes especially critical. Street vendors often operate under less stringent regulatory oversight compared to commercial food manufacturers. As a result, poor hygiene practices, such as using the same tools for raw and cooked items, or not washing hands between tasks, can lead to cross-contamination. Serological tests can detect traces of saliva, blood, or fecal matter on utensils, surfaces, or food items, which are strong indicators of unsafe handling practices. This kind of forensic evidence is invaluable during public health investigations when tracing the source of foodborne outbreaks like hepatitis A or norovirus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A more disturbing and emerging concern in the domain of food forensics is the intentional or accidental addition of sedatives to packaged or even street food.&nbsp;<strong>Sedaives</strong>&nbsp;such as benzodiazepines, antihistamines, or tranquilizers have been detected in some food items, either as a means to calm consumers or mask symptoms of spoilage in animals before slaughter. These practices pose serious health risks, including neurological issues, organ damage, and even increased vulnerability to accidents due to drowsiness. Vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and individuals with pre-existing conditions are particularly at risk. Forensic serology, in combination with toxicological analysis techniques like liquid chromatography&ndash;mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), can detect and quantify such substances, contributing to the identification of contaminated food sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The use of forensic serology in these contexts also carries legal implications. Evidence derived from these tests can support regulatory enforcement and legal action against vendors or manufacturers who violate food safety norms. In the case of sedative contamination, serological and toxicological findings may be pivotal in proving criminal negligence or intentional harm. Therefore, integrating forensic serology into routine food safety inspections and public health investigations can significantly enhance consumer protection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In conclusion, forensic serology is a vital component of modern food forensics. Its ability to detect biological contamination, authenticate food products, and trace sources of foodborne illness or chemical adulteration makes it particularly valuable for ensuring the safety of both packaged and street-vended foods. As threats like sedative contamination become more prominent, the role of forensic science in maintaining food integrity and protecting public health is more crucial than ever.</p>	blog_images/FOrensic_role.png	Dr. Nilanjan Chattopadhyay	author_images/Dr.Nilanjan_Chattopadhyay.jpg	Dr. Nilanjan Chattopadhyay is a Serologist and Chemical Examiner, serving as Senior Chief Medical Officer (SAG) at the Institute of Serology, located at 3, Kyd Street, Kolkata – 700016.

5	Ayurveda Aahara	Ayurveda, the ancient system of medicine, emphasizes the integral relationship between Aahara(food) and Swasthaya(overall health). . It is important to introduce the concept of Ayurveda Aahara to align the traditional knowledge with modern aspect to the improve health status of the people.	<h4>Ayurveda, the ancient system of medicine, emphasizes the integral relationship between Aahara (food) and Swasthaya (overall health). This holistic approach views food as a powerful tool for both prevention and healing, where the qualities of food are carefully matched to the individual&#39;s Prakriti (constitution), Vikriti (diseased state of body), and Ritu (the prevailing environmental factors). Aahara influences the balanced and imbalanced state of Doshas i.e. Vata, Pitta, Kapha. It is important to introduce the concept of Ayurveda Aahara to align the traditional knowledge with modern aspect to the improve health status of the people.</h4>\r\n\r\n<h4><br />\r\n<strong> Concept of Aahara in Ayurveda:</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Aahara is considered one among TRAYO-UPSTAMBBHA (three pillars of Ayurveda) i.e. Aahara, Nidra and Brahmacharya. Acharya Kashyap has said Aahara as महाभैषज्य (Aahara is best of all medicines).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>स्वास्थस्य स्वास्थ्य रक्षणमातुरस्य विकार प्रशमनं च I (Charak)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Acharya Charaka has described the Prayojana of Ayurveda as to maintain the health of healthy individual and to treat the disease of sick individuals. Protecting the health of the healthy and relieving the disorders of the sick. Ayurveda focuses on first maintaining the health of healthy individual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong> Necessities to Introduce the Different Category of Food as Ayurveda Aahara:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Aahara, a key concept in Ayurveda, emphasizes the importance of diet and nutrition in maintaining health and preventing disease. By adhering to Ayurvedic principles, we can offer products that align with these traditional health guidelines and genuinely support well-being.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; Ayurveda also having the concept of Nidana Parivarjana, which focuses on avoiding the causative agents of diseases. Integrating Aahara into our product offerings can help in implementing Nidana Parivarjana, thereby addressing and potentially alleviating various health problems faced by people today.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; By promoting authentic Ayurvedic principles and offering genuinely healthy products, we can provide valuable support to individuals seeking to improve their health and well-being.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> Definition of Ayurveda Aahara as per FSS (AA) Regulation, 2022</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>[FSS (AA) Regulation- Food Safety and Standards (Ayurveda Aahara Regulation)</strong>\r\n\r\n\t<p>&ldquo;Ayurveda Aahara&rdquo; means a food prepared in accordance with the recipes or ingredients or processes as per method described in the authoritative books of Ayurveda listed under &lsquo;Schedule A&rsquo; of these regulations including products which have other botanical ingredients in accordance with the concept of Ayurveda Aahara but does not include Ayurvedic drugs or proprietary Ayurvedic medicines and medicinal products, cosmetics, narcotic or psychotropic substances, herbs listed under Schedule E-1 of Drug and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and the Drug and Cosmetics Rules, 1945, metals based Ayurvedic drugs or medicines, bhasma or pishti and any other ingredients notified by the Authority from time to time.</p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion:</strong>\r\n\r\n\t<p>This initiative highlights the importance of a healthy diet as the primary means to maintain health. In Ayurveda, the principle of Nidana Parivarjana is applicable for the treatment of all diseases, so integrating Ayurvedic principles with Aahara will aid in disease prevention and control.

7	Changing Scenario of Artificial Ripening of Fruits	Mango fruits are abundantly available in the fruit markets nowadays. Some traders are using calcium carbide to ripen the mangoes, which is banned under the Food Safety and Standards Act of the Government of India. Generally, fruit traders/growers harvest immature/ mature but unripe fruits from the orchards, pack them in boxes or plastic crates, and place 2-3 paper sachets of 5-10g calcium carbide in each layer in the box/crate.	<p>Mango fruits are abundantly available in the fruit markets nowadays. Some traders are using calcium carbide to ripen the mangoes, which is banned under the Food Safety and Standards Act of the Government of India. Generally, fruit traders/growers harvest immature/ mature but unripe fruits from the orchards, pack them in boxes or plastic crates, and place 2-3 paper sachets of 5-10g calcium carbide in each layer in the box/crate. Sometimes up to 5-7 sachets are found in each box containing 5-10 kg of fruit. Within 5-7 days the trucks containing such mangoes reach the fruit/vegetable market from far-off growing areas for trading to the wholesalers and retailers. Similarly, other fruits like bananas, papaya, sapota, and even plums are also ripened by using calcium carbide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Calcium carbide traditionally used for ripening fruits in the form of a powder/granules is known to absorb moisture and produce acetylene, which being a weak analogue of ethylene, is responsible for triggering the ripening process. On ripening by calcium carbide, the green fruits turn yellow with little increase in sweetness. Though fruits appear ripened, they remain unripe and sour from within. The aroma, flavor, and taste of carbide gas-ripened mangoes also smell slightly different as compared to naturally ripened mangoes. Such fruits have a very short shelf life and deteriorate within a very short period.<br />\r\nCalcium carbide is commonly used in gas welding and is available as MASALA at a very cheap cost. Being easily available and simplicity of its use, calcium carbide is used extensively in the ripening of fruits. In the presence of moisture, when calcium carbide produces acetylene gas, it also produces arsine and phosphine gases, which are present as impurities in the calcium carbide. Both arsine and phosphine get deposited on the fruit surface and find entry in the outer skin (peel) and pulp. Accordingly, arsenic contents are found on the fruits from this arsine gas. Experimentally, it has been found that mangoes collected from the fruit market contained arsenic content on the fruit surface, peel, and pulp from 35-107 microgram/kg (35-107 ppb). While those ripened without calcium carbide did not contain any arsenic. Thus, the estimation of arsenic can be used as a tool to identify calcium-carbide-ripened mangoes.<br />\r\nConsumption of carbide-ripened mangoes exerts adverse effects on health. Major symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, bloody stools, burning sensation in the chest and abdomen, difficulty in speaking and swallowing, etc. Sometimes the symptoms lead to a cancer-like dreaded disease. As such consumers need to be cautious and follow precautions while using such fruits.<br />\r\n<br />\r\ni. If you find carbide sachets in the fruit box or crate, do not use such fruits or use them only after treatment.<br />\r\nii. In case the fruits are deep yellow in color, with deep shining, or seem to contain a powder-like substance, it is an indication of carbide gas ripened mangoes.<br />\r\niii. Carbide-ripened mangoes look ripened only from the outer surface, from inside they remain unripe and tart in taste.<br />\r\niv. Dip mangoes in cold water or 2% sodium carbonate solution for at least 12 hours and wash properly before consumption. Experimentally, it has been observed that the use of this treatment reduced arsenic content from the fruit surface, peel, and pulp by 85-89%.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTherefore, consumers can either stop the consumption of carbide-ripened mangoes or use them after following the above treatment to avoid any ill health-related issues. It is a matter of satisfaction that things have started changing with the consistent efforts of the Food Authority. Bananas are now being ripened by using ethylene gas in chambers. A few mangoes are also being ripened using FSSAI-approved ethylene sachets. Hence, with sustained efforts and bringing awareness among consumers, the menace of calcium carbide in fruit ripening</p>	blog_images/Changing_artificial.png	Prof. Dr. PC Sharma	author_images/Dr._PC_Sharma.jpg	Dr. P.C.

8	Carbohydrates Are Not to Be Blamed for the Occurrence of Obesity - Let’s Get the Right Perspective	Let’s us understand carbohydrates, its role in the body, what happens when it is consumed more or less and the right way of consuming carbohydrates	<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s us understand carbohydrates, its role in the body, what happens when it is consumed more or less and the right way of consuming carbohydrates</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of you might have heard from various social media platforms and other forums about carbohydrates (carbs) and its relation in the occurrence of non-communicable disease (NCDs) especially obesity. But the reality is different, there are several other factors responsible for the occurrence of NCDs, especially the crash diet, lack of physical activity, sedentary lifestyle and taking too much stress. With the available scientific evidence, it is to state that carbohydrates in general term are not the culprit causing NCDs. It is the form of carbohydrate which we are taking is of importance. There are several popular dietary recommendations in place that vary in nutritional composition, but all prioritize proteins and fats over carbs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the contrary, our ICMR dietary guidelines on Indian Foods prescribes balanced diet for every healthy individual. Balanced diet is the one which provides required amount of calories, protein, vitamins, minerals &amp; adequate fibre which the individual need. (In other words, it fulfils all the nutritional needs of the body). We all know that no single food can provide all the necessary nutrients that is required for the body and there is a need of a judicious mix of variety of foods in our daily diet which can provide the macro &amp; micro nutrients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="Veg &amp; Non Veg Symbol" src="https://blogs.fssai.gov.in/img/img-2.png" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The carbohydrates, proteins &amp; fats are called as Macro nutrients which are needed in large quantity, while the vitamins and minerals are termed as micro nutrients required in small amount for the body. Foods rich in carbohydrates and fats are called as energy yielding foods, foods rich in proteins are called as body building foods and foods rich in vitamins and minerals are termed as protective foods.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe energy requirement of an individual is the level of energy intake from food that will balance energy expenditure. The energy requirement is calculated based on the energy expenditure. The estimate is made for different age group, the energy and the quantity of nutrients needed vary with age, gender, physiological conditions (pregnancy, lactation) &amp; physical activity and type of lifestyle as sedentary, moderately active &amp; heavily active.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe proportion of food to be sourced from different food groups as listed below to meet the Indian dietary requirement, however variation can occur in terms of intake based on the food availability, accessibility, affordability, demands of the body and bioavailability. The average requirements of the recommended dietary allowance can be satisfied over a period of time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>It is ideal to have foods from at least 5 to 7 food groups such as</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Cereals &amp; millets</li>\r\n\t<li>Pulses &amp; legumes</li>\r\n\t<li>Nuts, oilseeds, oils &amp; fats</li>\r\n\t<li>Vegetables, Green leafy vegetables</li>\r\n\t<li>Milk</li>\r\n\t<li>Meat &amp; flesh foods</li>\r\n\t<li>Roots &amp; tubers</li>\r\n\t<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Ideally 45% of the calories can be derived from cereals &amp; millets, 15% calories from pulses, beans &amp; meat and rest of the calories shall ideally be derived from vegetables, fruits, nuts &amp; oilseeds and milk. The ICMR dietary guidelines on Indian Foods 2024 recommended to have 50 to 55% of total calories from carbohydrates, 10 to 15% from protein and 20 to 30% from fats. For example, for a sedentary male 2110kcals/day is the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), as per the above, he shall derive 1055 to 1160 kcals from carbohydrates, 211kcals to 316 kcals from protein &amp; 422kcals to 633kcals from fats (1g of carbohydrate and protein will provide 4kcals each and 1 g of gat will provide 9kcals)</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<li>As per ICMR, to meet these requirements through vegetarian diet an individual shall consume per day 250g of cereals including millets, 85g pulses, 300g milk/curd, 400g vegetables &amp; green leafy vegetables, 100g fruits, 35g nuts &amp; oil seeds and 27g of fats &amp; oils can be consumed. In case of non- vegetarian diet 55g can be from pulses &amp; 70 g can be from chicken/meat.<br />\r\n\t<strong>It is our paramount duty to follow and abide with the authentic information and the recommendations of the highest body established for the purpose and not to go with any invalidated shares /articles which has no sanctity.</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ICMR guidelines also quoted that 56.4% of total disease burden in India is due to unhealthy diet in addition, the proliferation of highly processed food, supported by aggressive marketing, rapid unplanned urbanization and changing lifestyles have contributed to more people eating unhealthy diets high in energy, free sugars, salt, from saturated fats and trans fats.<br />\r\n\t<strong>Let&rsquo;s us understand carbohydrates, its role in the body, what happens when it is consumed more or less and the right way of consuming carbohydrates</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCarbohydrates is one of the macro nutrient that provide the primary energy source for the body. Carbohydrates are grouped as Simple &amp; complex in general terms<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Simple carbohydrates:</strong>&nbsp;Monosaccharides and disaccharides are called as Simple carbohydrates. Glucose, fructose and galactose are examples of single-unit sugars, also known as monosaccharides. Sucrose (table sugar is a combination of glucose and fructose) lactose (milk sugar is a combination of glucose &amp; galactose) and Maltose (is a combination of two units of glucose) are double-unit sugars are called disaccharides. These easily are utilized for energy, causing a rapid rise in blood sugar<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFoods that contains mono &amp; disaccharides are chocolates, candies, carbonated beverages, corn syrup, ready to drink fruit juice, honey, table sugar etc.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Complex carbohydrates:</strong>&nbsp;Starches and dietary fibres are examples of complex carbohydrates Starches contain a large number of glucose molecules. They are also called as polysaccharides and the plants produces these polysaccharides. Examples include roots &amp; tubers, potatoes, rice and wheat.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDietary fibre consists of non- starch polysaccharides commonly called as roughage and cannot be broken down completely by the human digestive system. It provides sense of fullness and prolonged satiety. It also adds to the bulk that facilitates easy defecation. Fibre rich diet allows gradually degradation of carbohydrates and low serum glucose oscillations. Dietary fibre has two main subtypes: soluble fibre and insoluble fibre which are components of plant-based foods such as legumes, whole grains, cereals, vegetables, fruits, and nuts or seeds.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSoluble fibres dissolves in water. It helps decrease blood cholesterol and LDL levels and blunts postprandial blood glucose levels. Examples are oats, guar gum, rye, barley, fleshy fruit, banana, figs, plums, apple, berries, carrot, broccoli, dried beans &amp; legumes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInsoluble fibre does not dissolve in water, remains in the intestines, thereby softening and bulking the stool. Coarsely ground insoluble fibre triggers the secretion of mucus in the large intestine providing bulking. However, finely ground insoluble fiber does not have this effect and instead can cause a constipation. Examples: whole grain foods, wheat &amp; corn brans, seeds, nuts, unripe banana and skin of kiwi, grape, tomato &amp; potato.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>These are long chain molecules and take longer to digest and have a more gradual effect on the increase in blood sugar.</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe all should understand the difference between the Added Sugars &amp; Naturally occurring simple sugars<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Added sugars are sugars and sugar syrups added to foods and drinks during processing and preparation and they include sugars (free, mono and disaccharides), sugars from syrups and honey, jaggery etc.<br />\r\n\t\t&bull; Whereas the naturally occurring simple sugars are the ones inherently present in the food. For example, glucose or fructose in fruits sugar molecules like sucrose (sugar) or lactose in milk.</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow we had a broad idea of the different types of carbohydrates. The Current lifestyle and consumption of highly refined carbohydrate-dense food have a role to play in development of disease through appetite and satiety signalling disruption. The abusive consumption of refined, simple, and low-quality carbohydrates has a direct implication on the physical and mental pathophysiology and raise the level of glucose in blood. Intake of added sugars more than 25 g or 5 teaspoons per day are considered unfavourable. In addition, a high-sugar diet and the simple carbohydrates in the form of added sugar or in processed foods, sweets and refined foods are the concern and to be taken minimal, whereas inclusion of non-starchy vegetables, green leafy vegetables, fresh fruits, cereals &amp; grains (minimally polished) and foods having dietary fibre can be taken liberally. ICMR recommends having energy from 5% added sugar of total energy intake (which is 25 g or 5 teaspoons per day)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe carbohydrates in the foods are broken down into glucose and are converted to energy to be utilised by the body. Any extra glucose in the bloodstream is stored in the liver and muscle tissue. If we consume more carbohydrates than the requirement, the body stores some of these carbohydrates as glycogen and converts the rest to fat. Glycogen is a complex carbohydrate that the body can easily and rapidly convert to energy. Glycogen is stored in the liver and the muscles. If a person consumes less carbohydrates than that is required, then the protein &amp; fats are spared to provide energy, whereas they have several other important roles in the body.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnother eye opener which we always search is whether rice or wheat is good, which is good for pre diabetic / diabetic. It is stated that there are no differences in Glycaemic index*(GI) of wheat chapatti and rice based mixed meals with equivalent AvCHO (Available carbohydrate) content of the staple. However, diet prescriptions often advices for wheat products, this not only limits choice of cereal consumption but also affects compliance of those who have been brought up consuming rice traditionally as a staple. It is widely known that GI of wheat is lower than that of rice, but there are no studies which analysed GI in these cereals based on AvCHO content. Rice and wheat are both cereals having a similar quotient of protein, fat and carbohydrates, it is the individual choice &amp; preference in choosing the grains based on the consumption pattern over years., however the portion control is the key. Also, the matrix in which it is taken is important like, if it is taken in liquid form or in the form of porridge has different impact in the sugar level compared to the form such as roti, idli, dosa etc. Wheat has double the amount of dietary fibre compared to rice.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe also need to understand that both sugar and jaggery has high calorie, only difference is the jaggery has some minerals such as iron, magnesium, potassium etc. Honey contains little less calories per gram than white sugar but due to its viscosity a teaspoon of honey has equal or more calorie than the sugar in terms of glucose-raising properties honey has about the same effects on blood glucose as white sugar &amp; jaggery.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Glycemic index is the measure of the increase in the level of blood glucose by eating a specific carbohydrate compared with eating a standard amount of glucose The glycemic index is a scale that ranks the number of carbohydrates in foods from zero to 100, indicating how quickly a food causes a person&rsquo;s blood sugar to rise.<br />\r\n\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t<ol>\r\n\t\t\t<li>&bull; Low GI: &le; 55<br />\r\n\t\t\t&bull; Medium GI: 56&ndash;69<br />\r\n\t\t\t&bull; High GI: &ge; 70&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t\t</ol>\r\n\t\t</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\r\n\t<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Be Selective</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Opt for the right sources of carbohydrates in your daily diet.</li>\r\n\t<li>Minimize consumption of refined foods.</li>\r\n\t<li>Incorporate nutrient-rich cereals like millets into your meals.</li>\r\n\t<li>Include fiber-rich foods and starchy foods in moderation.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Be Mindful</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Focus on your chewing: Eating slowly by chewing thoroughly helps control portion sizes and promotes satiety.</li>\r\n\t<li>Practice conscious eating: If you indulge in snacks, sweets, or processed foods, balance it out by avoiding such items in the following days.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Be in Control</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Limit added sugar intake to 25 grams (5 teaspoons) per day.</li>\r\n\t<li>Maintain portion control to avoid overconsumption.</li>\r\n\t<li>Respect your body: Treat it as a temple by providing the right food in the right proportion and at the right intervals.</li>\r\n</ul>	blog_images/Carb.png	Dr. Kavitha Ramasamy	author_images/Dr_BfomMWj._Kavitha_Ramasamy.jpg	Dr. Kavitha Ramasamy, Joint Director at FSSAI, holds a PhD in Food & Nutrition and works to ensure safe and healthy food for all through effective food standards and regulations.	2025-01-02
12	Ensuring Safe and Nutritious Food: The Vital Role of FSSAI in India	In today's health-conscious world, the significance of access to safe and nutritious food cannot be overstated. As consumers become increasingly aware of the link between diet and overall well-being, the responsibility falls on regulatory bodies to uphold food safety standards.

As consumers become increasingly aware of the link between diet and overall well-being, the responsibility falls on regulatory bodies to uphold food safety standards. In India, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) stands as a cornerstone of assurance, ensuring the safety of the food supply chain across the nation for protecting public health and maintaining consumer confidence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nunder the Food Safety and Standards Act (FSS), 2006, FSSAI operates as the apex food regulatory body in the country with the mandate to ensure safe and wholesome food for all citizens. As a part of its core regulatory functions, FSSAI sets science-based, globally benchmarked standards for food safety; ensures credible food testing for quality and compliance to these standards and processes through effective surveillance mechanisms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The food authority has a Scientific Committee and 21 Scientific Panels that are its principal scientific arms in the standards development process. The authority has empanelled more than 200 scientific experts from different scientific organisations such as ICMR, CSIR, ICAR, NIFTEM, IITs and various institutes working in the area of food safety and nutrition. These panels are constantly engaged in developing standards for categories ranging from cereals, milk and milk products, fruits, vegetables and spices, oils and fats, water, fish and fisheries, meat and meat products, sweets, genetically modified organisms and food, food additives etc.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFSSAI&rsquo;s role is vital to ensure maintenance of food quality all throughout the food value chain, be it in the inspection of food manufacturing facility or distribution or retail facility and subsequent laboratory testing as defined under the FSS Act. The government already has a framework in place with food safety commissioners heading at the state level, designated officers at the sub-divisional level and more than 4,000 food safety officers keeping a sharp vigil against food adulteration and contamination. In order to ensure better quality control of food manufactured/distributed/supplied in the market, there are also 246 FSSAI-notified food laboratories in the country with state-of-the-art infrastructure and highly-qualified experts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnforcement is undertaken on the basis of surveillance, monitoring, inspection and random sampling of food products carried out by the officials of Food Safety Departments. FSSAI has in-place digital tools for inspection and sampling namely FoSCoRIS which helps field officers in recording their observations along with capturing real-time data during inspections such as images, uploading of records etc. Captured Sample Details, are then forwarded to Labs through FSSAI&rsquo;s InFoLNet portal for uploading of lab test reports. These lab test reports are then made available digitally to all concerned jurisdictional authorities. The historical data regarding food business establishments helps authorities to take rationalised approach while conducting enforcement activities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFood Safety Connect App has been developed to connect consumers with the Authority and is available to the consumers for lodging their Food Safety Grievances from anywhere in the country and get its timely and satisfactory resolution.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEmpowering food safety officials, food handlers and food business operators (FBOs) with the necessary tools to implement food safety and quality through training has been a focus area for FSSAI, and it has trained more than 1.5 million food handlers and FBOs since 2017. FSSAI plans to scale up its training programme to 2.5 million food handlers and FBOs in the next three years.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo improve nutritional status of children, FSSAI has notified the Food Safety and Standards (Safe food and balanced diets for children in school) Regulations, 2020. With effect from 1st July, 2021, it restricts the availability of foods high in saturated fat or trans-fat or added sugar or sodium in school campus or within 50 metres of the schools. This regulation prohibits the advertisement or marketing of food products, high in saturated fats or trans fats or added sugar or sodium within school campuses or within fifty metre radius. It also promotes consumption of safe and balanced diet in and around school campus.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFSAAI uses various tools and mediums to promote to promote safer, healthier and sustainable food habits in the country. For mass consumer awareness and bringing about a shift in eating behaviour, emphasis has been placed on encouraging healthy food choices. FSSAI launched the &ldquo;Aaj Se Thoda Kam&rdquo; mass awareness campaign to reduce salt, fat and sugar in diets. Apart from this, FSSAI promotes a variety of foods considering the vast diversity in diet, culture, customs etc. for wholesome nutrition. Citizens are nudged to make right food choices and promote diet diversification with a variety of whole grains ranging from wheat and rice, which are commonly consumed, to millets and other indigenous grains for better nutrition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOver the years, FSSAI has been providing regulatory stewardship by setting-up robust food standards comparable to international benchmarks; finalising important regulations for regulating the food ecosystem; and strengthening compliance and surveillance efforts. On the other hand, FSSAI has also taken up a large-scale citizen centric campaign through its flagship initiative &lsquo;Eat Right India&rsquo; for social and behavioural change; as well as awareness generation efforts so that everyone can have access to safe, healthy and sustainable diets.</p>	blog_images/Ensuring.png	Shri G.

Carbon, Nitrogen, Phosphorous etc. as body constituents and micro elements viz. Iron, Cobalt and Zink which are constituents of body metabolism. Heavy metals are micro elements and are so called because of their high density and also biological importance in trace amounts; the term heaviness is also linked to their toxicity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNon-essential heavy metals viz. lead, cadmium, mercury, etc. are highly toxic even at very low concentrations, they are non -biodegradable and cause severe toxic effects to living organisms.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Essential Heavy metals viz. vanadium, manganese, selenium, nickel and arsenic are less toxic at low concentrations and they act as coenzyme in biological process. For example hemoglobin and Myoglobin consist of Iron, Vitamin B12 consist of cobalt.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nArsenic and their compounds cause urinary bladder, liver, and lung cancers. Hexavalent chromium causes lung cancer and nickel and its compounds cause nasal cavity and lung cancers. All these elements cause cancers to human beings by the route of exposure is through inhalation and ingestion. The toxicity of mercury depends on its chemical composition. Methyl mercury is more toxic than inorganic mercury and is a cause of concern in sea food. Due to its toxic nature and historical incidents like Minamata.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRegarding the availability of various heavy metals in the earth&rsquo;s crust is about 5%, among which iron occupies nearly 95%. Heavy metals enter food chain through various environmental sources such as air, water, and soil which mostly gets polluted due to increased industrial activities in recent years.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFood Safety and Standards (Contaminants, Toxins and Residues) Regulation, 2011, has specified maximum limits of metal contaminants in different food categories based on risk assessment studies. A robust food testing ecosystem has been established by FSSAI by strengthening primary food testing labs and referral food labs. Heavy metals are commonly analysed by equipments like AAS, ICP-OES, ICP-MS, etc which have capabilities of quantitatively analysing toxic heavy metals viz. lead, cadmium, chromium and, mercury at sub ppb level with high accuracy.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><img src="https://blogs.fssai.gov.in/img/Blog3Img1.jpg" style="height:200px; width:200px" /></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><img src="https://blogs.fssai.gov.in/img/Blog3Img2.jpg" style="height:200px; width:200px" /></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><img src="https://blogs.fssai.gov.in/img/Blog3Img3.jpg" style="height:200px; width:200px" /></td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>	blog_images/Heavy_metals_qBDfFmo.png	Dr. Debadutta Mishra	author_images/Dr_YRP4T7j._Debadutta_Mishra.png	Dr. Debadutta Mishra is the Joint Director of the National Food Laboratory at FSSAI Kolkata.	2024-06-07
14	How to Read Food Labels: “Choose Healthy and Stay Healthy”	All of us want to eat healthy and stay healthy. For that, we need to choose healthy food.\r\nDo you find it challenging when it comes to making healthy food choices? Do not worry. The food label is a simple and quick tool to help you make healthy food choices.	<p>All of us want to eat healthy and stay healthy. For that, we need to choose healthy food.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you find it challenging when it comes to making healthy food choices? Do not worry. The food label is a simple and quick tool to help you make healthy food choices.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAny packaged food has at least two sides the &ldquo;Front of Pack&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Back of Pack&rdquo;. In the next few steps, we shall see how to read the &ldquo;Front of Pack&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Back of Pack&rdquo; of the food label.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe &ldquo;Front of Pack&rdquo; carries information on name, brand name and picture of the product, logos and claims. What is important for us to see is to look for the vegetarian and non-vegetarian logo that looks like this<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="Veg &amp; Non Veg Symbol" src="https://blogs.fssai.gov.in/img/vegNonVeg.png" title="This logo helps you choose foods that fit into your dietary habits." /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThis logo helps you choose foods that fit into your dietary habits.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &ldquo;Front of Pack&rdquo; may also have a nutrition claim like -&nbsp;<strong>Low sugar, Low sodium, Low salt, Trans fat free/Zero trans fats, Cholesterol free/Zero cholesterol/ No cholesterol, Good source of Vitamins, Good source of Minerals.</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe nutrition claims may also appear as -&nbsp;<strong>Added Vitamin B12, Reduced fat, High in iron and Calcium/ Calcium and iron rich, Source of fiber/High in fiber, Source of protein, High in Vitamin B1,B2,B3,B6, Sugar-free or No added sugar.</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nFoods with nutrition claims have a nutritional benefit and hence we must prefer these to those that do not carry a claim.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome packages may carry a claim regarding health benefit that the food offers like -&nbsp;<strong>Good for heart, Healthy heart, Reduces the risk of heart diseases.</strong>&nbsp;Note that such products should have&nbsp;<strong>zero cholesterol, no trans-fat, low saturated fat, low salt or sodium.</strong>&nbsp;Where will you find this information? On the &ldquo;Back of Pack&rdquo;. So check for&nbsp;<strong>zero cholesterol, zero trans fat, low saturated fat, low salt or sodium on the &ldquo;Nutrition Facts Panel&rdquo;.</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe &ldquo;Back of Pack&rdquo; carries a lot of other information besides the&nbsp;<strong>Nutrition Facts Panel like - Pack Size, Quality Symbol, Price, Batch No., Manufacturing and Best before date, Manufacturer&rsquo;s address, Cooking Instructions, Ingredients list and Allergen Information, Added Colors and Flavors Information.</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo what all should we read to make a healthy food choice? The -&nbsp;<strong>Nutrition Facts Panel, Ingredients list and Allergen Information and Added Colors and Flavors Information.</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe must remember that the &ldquo;nutrients of concern&rdquo; are&nbsp;<strong>Sugar, Fat and Salt/Sodium.</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet us see how the ingredients list helps us in choosing a healthy product.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf ingredients like&nbsp;<strong>sugar/ jaggery/ honey/ high fructose corn syrup</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>OR</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Fat/oil/ Shortening/ Hydrogenated oils /Partially Hydrogenated Oils/Butter/Margarine</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>OR</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Salt/monosodium glutamate/ Autolyzed vegetable protein/ Hydrolyzed vegetable protein/ Sodium caseinate&nbsp;</strong>appear in 1st, 2nd or 3rd position in the ingredients list then the product is likely to be unhealthy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe food label also helps you choose foods that are allergen free. You will find a list of allergens present (if they are) right under the ingredients list. Allergen information is given in the following way -&nbsp;<strong>Gelatin free, Gluten free, Contains no MSG OR Contains soy, milk, corn, nuts, mustard seeds, eggs, MSG.</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nChoose food products that have fewer additives like&nbsp;<strong>- synthetic/artificial colour, artificial flavor, preservatives, additives that start with &ldquo;INS&rdquo;</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;CHOOSE HEALTHY AND STAY HEALTHY&rdquo;.</strong></p>	blog_images/HowToReadFoodLabels.jpg	Dr. Suneeta Chandorkar	author_images/Dr._Suneeta_Chandorkar.jpg	Dr. Suneeta Chandorkar is an Assistant Professor (Grade 3) in the Department of Foods and Nutrition at The M.

16	Dietary Diversity for a Healthy Lifestyle	Dietary diversity refers to the variety of different foods or food groups consumed over a specific period, typically in a day or a week. It is a key component of a healthy diet, emphasizing the consumption of a broad range of nutrients necessary for maintaining health and preventing disease.	<p>Dietary diversity refers to the variety of different foods or food groups consumed over a specific period, typically in a day or a week. It is a key component of a healthy diet, emphasizing the consumption of a broad range of nutrients necessary for maintaining health and preventing disease.<br />\r\nA diverse diet helps ensure that an individual gets sufficient amounts of vitamins, minerals, proteins, fats, and carbohydrates necessary for overall health. This variety helps prevent nutrient deficiencies and supports optimal body performance.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consuming a variety of foods can lower the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. For example, fruits, vegetables, and nuts are rich in antioxidants that help protect against these conditions. By incorporating a wide range of foods, individuals can benefit from the protective effects of different nutrients.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA varied diet supports a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for digestion, immune function, and overall health. Different foods provide different types of fiber and prebiotics, which feed beneficial gut bacteria.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEmbracing dietary diversity can promote cultural appreciation and social bonding. Different foods often come from different cultures and traditions, encouraging the exploration and enjoyment of global cuisines. This not only enhances culinary experiences but also fosters a greater understanding and appreciation of diverse cultures.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVariety in the diet can prevent boredom with meals. Thus, making it easier to maintain healthy eating habits in the long term. Diverse diets can be more satisfying and enjoyable, promoting better adherence to healthy eating patterns.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDiverse diets can make populations more resilient to food supply disruptions. Reliance on a single or few staple foods can make communities vulnerable to food shortages or price spikes. By incorporating a wide range of foods, individuals and communities can better withstand changes in food availability and economic conditions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIncorporating local and seasonal foods into your diet is another excellent way to enhance dietary diversity. Eating seasonally ensures you are consuming fruits and vegetables at their peak ripeness, which maximizes their nutritional value and flavor.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt also reduces the carbon footprint associated with transporting foods from distant places. Purchasing local foods supports local farmers which can lead to greater food security and community resilience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo achieve dietary diversity, individuals should aim to include various fruits and vegetables, whole grains such as brown rice, quinoa, oats, and whole wheat, diverse protein sources including legumes, nuts, seeds, dairy, eggs, fish, and lean meats, and healthy fats from sources like nuts and seeds. Additionally, different cooking methods can enhance nutrient intake and food enjoyment, while incorporating locally grown, seasonal produce adds flavor, nutrition, and sustainability to the diet.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHence, dietary diversity is a fundamental aspect of a healthy diet that contributes to enjoying a healthier, more vibrant life while appreciating the rich tapestry of global cuisines and supporting sustainable food.</p>	blog_images/SafeFood.jpg	Ms. Rima Rao	author_images/Ms._Rima_Rao.jpeg	Ms. Rima Rao, RD, is a Registered Dietitian, Nutritionist, and Wellness Consultant, and serves as the Convener of NetProFan Ahmedabad Chapter.	2024-06-07
6	Fortified Foods: Enhancing Nutritional Value	Fortified foods are those that have been enhanced with additional nutrients, either to replace nutrients lost during processing or to add nutrients that may not be naturally present in significant amounts. This practice aims to improve public health by addressing common nutritional deficiencies.	<p><strong>History and Rationale:-</strong><br />\r\nThe concept of food fortification dates back to the early 20th century, with notable examples including the addition of iodine to salt to prevent goiter and vitamin D to milk to combat rickets. Fortification became a public health strategy to tackle nutrient deficiencies that were common even in developed countries. There is no dispute that food fortification is a proven approach for addressing the dietary inadequacies of micronutrients like iodine, and Vitamins B1 and B2. India has successfully implemented the mandatory use of iodine fortified common salt (since 1989) and reduced the prevalence of iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) below the public health significance level. This has been achieved in a very systematic way, initially by conducting studies in goiter endemic locations to prove the efficacy and effectiveness of iodine fortification, then testing the strategy in other locations, and finally making the use of iodised salt mandatory with monitoring and risk assessment mechanisms in place. Since dietary available Iodine was very less, fortification was made a universal strategy in 2005-06 by GOI. (The Gazette of India, 2018).<br />\r\n<strong>Common Fortified Nutrients</strong><br />\r\n1. Vitamins:<br />\r\nVitamin D: added to dairy products and cereals to support bone health.<br />\r\nB Vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B6, B12, and folic acid): Commonly added to cereals and flour to prevent deficiencies that could lead to anemia and neurological issues.<br />\r\n2. Minerals:<br />\r\nIron: Added to cereals, flours, and rice to prevent iron-deficiency anemia.<br />\r\nCalcium: Fortified in juices, plant-based milk alternatives, and cereals to support bone health.<br />\r\nIodine: Added to table salt to prevent thyroid-related issues.<br />\r\n<strong>Benefits of Fortified Foods</strong><br />\r\n1. Nutritional Improvement: Fortification helps increase the intake of essential nutrients that people might otherwise lack in their diet, thereby improving overall health.<br />\r\n2. Prevention of Deficiencies: It plays a crucial role in preventing diseases caused by nutritional deficiencies such as rickets, scurvy, and beriberi.<br />\r\n3. Public Health Impact: Fortified foods have been instrumental in reducing the prevalence of conditions like neural tube defects, thanks to folic acid fortification.<br />\r\n<strong>Types of Fortification</strong><br />\r\n1. Mass Fortification: This involves adding nutrients to foods consumed widely by the general population, such as staple foods like flour, rice, and milk.<br />\r\n2. Targeted Fortification: Nutrients are added to foods consumed by specific groups, such as infants, pregnant women, or elderly individuals.<br />\r\n3. Market-driven Fortification: Food manufacturers add nutrients to products for competitive advantage and consumer health benefits, often seen in cereals, beverages, and snacks.<br />\r\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>&nbsp;Fortified foods represent a critical public health intervention, addressing micronutrient deficiencies and improving the nutritional quality of the diet. While they offer significant benefits, it is essential to balance fortification with potential risks, ensuring that it is part of a comprehensive strategy to improve nutrition and health outcomes.</p>	blog_images/FortifiedFood.png	Dr. Sirimavo Nair	author_images/Dr._Sirimavo_Nair.jpeg	Dr. Sirimavo Nair holds a Doctorate from the Faculty of Science at The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda, Gujarat.

9	Calcium Carbide or Ripening Masala Used in Fruits is Toxic	Calcium Carbide (CaC2) or Calcium acetylide is a grey or brown powder or solid widely used for generating acetylene gas or welding gas by small welders. Acetylene is a flammable gas and should be handled with care. Unfortunately, the same is used as an artificial ripening agent by many traders and few farmers for ripening of climacteric fruits like mango and banana. It is either put as small packets inside the packed fruit boxes or sprinkled on heaps of fruit in secluded areas away from the sigh	<p>Calcium Carbide (CaC2) or Calcium acetylide is a grey or brown powder or solid widely used for generating acetylene gas or welding gas by small welders. Acetylene is a flammable gas and should be handled with care. Unfortunately, the same is used as an artificial ripening agent by many traders and few farmers for ripening of climacteric fruits like mango and banana. It is either put as small packets inside the packed fruit boxes or sprinkled on heaps of fruit in secluded areas away from the sight of consumers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nDry Calcium carbide when comes in contact with water (moisture) forms acetylene gas and calcium hydroxide. Acetylene gas mimics ethylene (a natural plant ripening hormone) and hastens the ripening process in the fruits. A full mature fruit will produce enough ethylene by itself to make the fruit ripe. But fruits on a tree do not reach full maturity all at same time. As the mango season approaches, consumers will be impatiently waiting to taste the mango fruit, even paying a higher price. To make fast money traders (who are mostly pre-harvest contractors who lease the mango orchard immediately after flowering of trees) harvest even half or three-fourth mature fruits and forcibly ripen using calcium carbide.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA technical grade calcium carbide consists of 85% calcium carbide along with impurities of silicon carbide, calcium phosphide, calcium oxide, calcium nitride and calcium sulphides besides traces of arsenic and lead (heavy metal). Acetylene gas per-se may not remain on fruits, but the impurities present in the calcium carbide get attached to the fruits when it comes in contact during its usage. Studies have shown that significantly high amounts of iron, cobalt, arsenic and lead were detected in mango fruits treated with calcium carbide. Several reports have been published addressing health problem such as headache, dizziness, mood disturbances, sleepiness, mental confusion, seizures and diarrhoea due to the consumption of fruits treated with CaC2. It is also reported to cause cancer and neurological disorders.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDue to the potential hazard (physical being flammable and health), the use of calcium carbide as an artificial ripener is strongly prohibited in most South Asian countries. In India, use of calcium carbide for artificial ripening fruits is a punishable crime under Food Safety and Standards Act 2006, and Food Safety and Standards Regulations 2011. FSSAI permits only use of ethylene gas (100 ppm) for artificial ripening of fruits. External application of ethylene is required only in very low dose for triggering the ripening process in the fruit. After the trigger, fruits produce ethylene by itself through a biological process of auto-catalytic action. Fruits ripened using ethylene are safe and tastes better with good sweetness and aroma.

11	Are You Eating Ice-cream or Frozen Dessert?	There are two frozen delicacies available in the market, termed as “Ice cream” and “Frozen Dessert”. Both appear to be exactly similar in taste, appearance and other properties, but there is a significant difference. You will not know it until you read the label and see the list of ingredients.	<p>There are two frozen delicacies available in the market, termed as &ldquo;Ice cream&rdquo; and &ldquo;Frozen Dessert&rdquo;. Both appear to be exactly similar in taste, appearance and other properties, but there is a significant difference. You will not know it until you read the label and see the list of ingredients.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIce cream is a dairy term regulated by Food Safety and Standards Authority of India, that embodies the essence of dairy goodness. Crafted from natural milk cream and milk solids, it remains an unparalleled delicacy. Frozen dessert, on the other hand, has either non-milk protein or non-milkfat or both added to substitute milk protein or milk fat or both.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMilk fat or cream is the costliest component of milk and hence the substitution of milk fat with cost-effective vegetable oils in frozen desserts has been a common practice. However, this substitution, often driven by commercial interests, blurs the lines between authenticity and imitation. Though often claimed as a healthier alternative, frozen desserts lack the inherent nutritional superiority of milk fat. Milk fat is naturally much superior than any vegetable oil, but it was wrongly blamed for its association with cardio-vascular diseases under the promotional influences of vegetable oil lobby for several years. Subsequent clinical trials conducted to substantiate the hypothesis could never establish the causal link between milk fat and CVD. However, some manufacturers took advantage of the wrong hypothesis and made frozen dessert, replacing milk fat with vegetable oils. This costed them less but could sell at higher prices and often with unsubstantiated health claims as a marketing strategy. In effect, the manufacturer of frozen dessert uses the brand equity of ice cream to market such an analogue product! However, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India Regulations, 2011 made it clear that you cannot use the term&nbsp;<strong>ice cream&nbsp;</strong>for such products, and they need to label them as&nbsp;<strong>frozen dessert.</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nIce creams need to follow strict regulatory standards for milk solids, wherein milk fat content cannot be less than 10% and milk protein content cannot be less than 3.5%, with permitted variation in the medium fat and low fat ice cream varieties. No vegetable fat and / or Vegetable protein is allowed to be added in ice-creams. Frozen desserts can contain vegetable oils or vegetable proteins or both, and does not necessarily contain milk solids. In both the products, it is to add sugar, nutritive sweeteners, fruit and fruit products, chocolate, flavors, stabilizers, etc as per the list of ingredients approved under FSSAI regulations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFriends, both the products are regulated and are most favorite delicacies, especially in summer months. However, you must read the label and look for milk fat content or vegetable oil content to differentiate these two products and choose the right one you intend to consume. After all, it is your choice, but as a dairy professional it is our moral duty to guide the consumer and help them make informed decisions.

13	Eat Right India: Transforming India’s Food Landscape	As the world advances and systems become more complex, food choices are changing drastically across the globe. Today, with rapid urbanization and changing lifestyles, dietary patterns have shifted towards pre-packaged foods, frozen foods, and fast food, including fried foods and desserts. This shift is increasing the burden of diet-related diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity.

It impacts our health, well-being and overall quality of life. The consumption of safe and nutritious food is pivotal in promoting good health, preventing diseases, and ensuring a sustainable and healthy future.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs the world advances and systems become more complex, food choices are changing drastically across the globe. Today, with rapid urbanization and changing lifestyles, dietary patterns have shifted towards pre-packaged foods, frozen foods, and fast food, including fried foods and desserts. This shift is increasing the burden of diet-related diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. India faces a silent epidemic today of rising childhood obesity coupled with under-nutrition and micronutrient deficiencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the focus on preventive healthcare through ensuring safe, healthy and sustainable food for all people, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare launched the Eat Right India movement in 2018. This movement is envisioned as a transformative large-scale change initiative that combines regulatory, capacity building and empowerment approaches judiciously to protect and advance public health and improve quality of life of all people. The movement is based on three key pillars of, &lsquo;Eat Safe, Eat Healthy and Eat Sustainable&rsquo; with the tagline - &lsquo;Sahi Bhojan Behtar Jeevan&rsquo; (right food, better life).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe &quot;Eat Safe&quot; component of the campaign focuses on food safety and hygiene. It aims to promote safe food handling practices, raise awareness about foodborne illnesses, and encourage people to buy food from trusted sources.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe &quot;Eat Healthy&quot; component of the campaign aims to promote a balanced and nutritious diet. It encourages people to eat a variety of foods from different food groups, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds. The campaign also promotes the use of locally grown and seasonal foods, which are more nutritious and environmentally sustainable.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe &quot;Eat Sustainable&quot; component of the campaign aims to promote sustainable food production and consumption. It encourages people to reduce food waste, conserve natural resources, and support local farmers and food producers. The campaign also promotes the use of eco-friendly packaging and transportation methods to reduce the carbon footprint of food production and distribution.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Eat Right India&#39;s &ldquo;Whole of Government&rdquo; Approach</strong><br />\r\nEat Right India brings together diverse stakeholders from various institutions like government departments, consumer organisations, development partners, industry associations, academia, professional associations etc., working closely on the food systems identified from pre-existing multi-stakeholder platforms or coalitions working on various food-related issues. The movement adopts a &quot;whole of government&quot; approach, bringing together all food-related mandates from ministries of agriculture, health, environment and others<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Eat Right India&#39;s &ldquo;Whole of Society&rdquo; Approach</strong><br />\r\nFurthermore, since foodborne illnesses and various diet-related diseases cut across all age groups and all sections of the society, Eat Right India also adopts a &lsquo;whole of society&rsquo; approach, bringing all society groups together on a common platform.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe food systems being complex in nature invites a more holistic and coordinated approach. The &quot;whole of government&quot; and &quot;whole of society&quot; approaches adopted by FSSAI underpin its role as &quot;enabler and reformer&quot; (as well as &quot;implementer&quot;) to build a positive, collaborative and inclusive environment to foster a sustainable food system in India.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGiven the size, spread and complexity of India, where a large proportion of the food businesses are in the unorganised sector, assuring safe and nutritious food to more than 1.40 billion citizens needs the participation of every stakeholder, and traditional regulatory tools alone cannot achieve this. Keeping this in mind, FSSAI has adopted a cluster approach for the unorganized sector through the Clean Street Food Hubs and Clean and Fresh Fruit and Vegetables Markets initiatives. For petty food vendors, who are part of a largely unregulated sector and are difficult to target individually, the cluster approach involves adopting a systematic process of gap analysis, filling infrastructure gaps, training and capacity building and certification and audit of such aggregation of vendors.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs part of the movement FSSAI, has also embarked on special initiatives like Eat Right Campus, Eat Right Schools, Eat Right Places of Worship &amp; Eat Right Stations. These initiatives aim at empowering consumers in their daily lives, individually and at campuses- such as offices, schools, universities and institutes- where they regularly spend considerable time and consume food.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFSSAI has also successfully conducted walkathons &amp; Eat Right Mela across the country, which are an info-tainment model to sensitize citizens to make the right food choices. The mela provides an opportunity to learn about safe food and healthy diets, including quick tests for adulterants, health and nutrition benefits of food, dietary advice by experts, information on Government programmes and initiatives, and much more.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Eat Right India movement represents a holistic approach to food safety, nutrition, and sustainability, aiming to improve the health and well-being of all Indians. By bringing together diverse stakeholders and utilizing a multifaceted strategy, FSSAI is fostering a positive and inclusive environment to build a sustainable food system in India.</p>	blog_images/2024-06-06.jpeg	Shri Uma Shankar Dhyani	author_images/Shri_Uma_Shankar_Dhyani.jpeg	Uma Shankar Dhyani is currently serving as an Executive Director at the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI).	2024-06-07

Consumption of artificial food dye has increased many folds in the last 50 years, and children are the biggest consumers.	<p>&ldquo;Whatever may be the father of a disease, all ill-diet is the mother&rdquo; as was rightly pronounced by Dr. George Herbert. Unhealthy processed foods have become a part of our daily diet. Such foods are often added with illegal food dyes specifically synthetic ones as coloring agents having genotoxic or carcinogenic properties and thus is a matter of public health concern. Consumption of artificial food dye has increased many folds in the last 50 years, and children are the biggest consumers. Some dyes may contain cancer-causing contaminants. Food dyes such as Erythrosine, Carmoisine, and Tartrazine are the leading causes of liver carcinogenesis. Azo dyes and triphenylmethanes are the most common classes of illegally added food dyes. The toxic activity of azo dyes, which are widely used in industry, is a result of their metabolism. The enzyme-mediated azo reduction leads to formation of active aromatic amines attacking DNA. Intake of</p>\r\n\r\n<p>these agents in amounts higher than the advised daily intake (ADI) has been shown to have adverse effects in mammalian models. An understanding of the causal mechanisms that link food color and cancer is still evolving. Adverse health effects of food colors are well documented.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe scenario of usage of synthetic food colours in India is changing. Till recently, eight synthetic dyes are permitted to be added upto a specified level, presence of any food color beyond what is permitted under the regulation renders the food unsafe. Known for its bright pink colouration, Rhodamine B the chemical is toxic for humans and can cause oxidative stress on cells and tissues if ingested.<br />\r\nFSSAI authorized food labs are equipped with paper chromatographic techniques for identification and uv-visible spectrophotometer and HPLC for quantification of food color.</p>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><img src="https://blogs.fssai.gov.in/img/Blog4Img1.jpg" style="height:265px; width:200px" /></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><img src="https://blogs.fssai.gov.in/img/Blog4Img2.jpg" style="height:280px; width:200px" /></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><img src="https://blogs.fssai.gov.in/img/Blog4Img3.jpg" style="height:200px; width:200px" /></td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>	blog_images/Rhodamine.png	Dr. Debadutta Mishra	author_images/Dr._Debadutta_Mishra.png	Dr. Debadutta Mishra is the Joint Director of the National Food Laboratory at FSSAI Kolkata.	2024-06-07
17	Fortified Foods	Maternal and child undernutrition is very common in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). A particularly widespread problem in LMICs is “hidden hunger”, or a chronic lack of essential vitamins and minerals such as iron, zinc, iodine, vitamin A and folic acid in the diet.	<p>Maternal and child undernutrition is very common in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). A particularly widespread problem in LMICs is &ldquo;hidden hunger&rdquo;, or a chronic lack of essential vitamins and minerals such as iron, zinc, iodine, vitamin A and folic acid in the diet. This occurs when consumption and absorption of micronutrients are too low to sustain good health and development. Hidden hunger impairs&nbsp;<strong>mental</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>physical development&nbsp;</strong>of children and adolescents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many factors contribute to micronutrient deficiencies such as poor diet, increased micronutrient needs during certain life stages, such as pregnancy and lactation, and health problems such as diseases, infections, or parasites.<br />\r\nMicronutrient deficiencies can be addressed by several ways including supplementation, dietary diversity and food fortification.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>What is Food Fortification?</strong><br />\r\nIt is the practice of adding of one or more micronutrients (i.e., vitamins and minerals) to commonly consumed foods during processing to improve the nutritional quality of the food supply and provide a public health benefit with minimal risk to health. Also, the addition of micronutrients can help to restore the micronutrient content lost during processing. It is a proven, safe and cost-effective strategy for improving diets and for the prevention and control of micronutrient deficiencies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Why fortification?</strong><br />\r\nCurrently, more than 70% of India&rsquo;s population consumes less than the daily recommended levels of micronutrients. This deficiency is affecting all the strata of the population be it rich, poor, young, old, urban or rural. However, women and children are more significantly affected by these deficiencies. Food fortification is gaining momentum in India to address the alarmingly high prevalence of vitamin and mineral deficiencies among India&rsquo;s 1.3 billion people. Fortified foods are helpful as they can fill in the gaps and increase a particular vitamin and mineral consumption that would otherwise be less than the recommended value. There is strong evidence that food fortification is effective in addressing micronutrient deficiencies. Foods fortified with folic acid will help in reducing birth of babies born with brain and spine birth defects, while foods fortified with folic acid and iron will reduce nutritional anaemia.<br />\r\nFSSAI has stablished standards for fortification of rice, wheat flour, edible oil, double fortified salt (DFS), and milk. Whole wheat flour (atta) is fortified with folic acid, iron and vitamin B12, common salt with iodine, milk with vitamin D.<br />\r\nConsumption of fortified foods is not a long-term solution for addressing micronutrient deficiencies. Undernutrition can be addressed by promoting dietary diversification, supporting agricultural development, raising awareness and education about nutrition, integrating nutrition into healthcare services, and implementing social protection programs. By taking a holistic approach to nutrition, we can create a world where everyone has access to the nutrients they need for a healthy life.</p>	blog_images/Fortfood.png	Dr. Asna Urooj	author_images/Dr._Asna_Urooj.jpg	Dr. Asna Urooj is a Professor in the Department of Studies in Food Science and Nutrition at the University of Mysore, Mysore.	2024-06-07

Just like how quantity and quality of food affects one&rsquo;s well-being, &lsquo;when to eat&rsquo; (meal timing) does impact metabolic health and well-being. The body&#39;s circadian rhythms are not exactly 24 hours long; instead, they are synchronized by Zeitgebers, which include exposition to light and food consumption.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnhealthy behaviours like inadequate sleep, skipping breakfast, not consuming largest meal during lunch, calorie dense snack, late night eating followed by late dinner with shorter interval between dinner and sleep (shorter evening latency) negatively affects the metabolic health and circadian rhythm.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn night owls or night shift workers, the melatonin (sleep hormone) levels go down which causes disturbed and unrefreshed sleep which in turn affects the production of appetite hormones thereby increasing risk of obesity, prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn breakfast skippers, low appetite signalling, and higher risk of increasing BMI was observed. The cortisol level increases post 30-60 minutes of awakening. It is better to consume the largest meal during 1-2pm. Studies show that people consume packaged and processed foods rich in sugar, refined carbohydrates, sodium, and unhealthy fat rich foods in the evening. Unhealthy, snacking pattern to be replaced with fruits, home prepared healthy snacks. At night, the melatonin production gradually increases, late and large dinner increases the risk of obesity and associated complications. The quality of sleep decreases with a shorter evening latency. Hence, it is always better to have an early and small, dinner preferably before 7pm.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Practicing mindful eating and having&nbsp;</strong>an early, healthy dinner can also help decrease midnight cravings.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe reasons for these unhealthy behaviours stem from lifestyle choices and environmental influences like using artificial lighting during night, constant changes in work timings, and constant access to processed foods. These unhealthy behaviours, unlike genetic factors, can be changed for the better, through lifestyle modifications. It takes only few days to switch over to a healthy dietary pattern and lifestyle.</p>	blog_images/Chrono.jpg	Dr. Meenakshi Bajaj	author_images/Dr._Meenakshi_Bajaj.jpeg	Dr. Meenakshi Bajaj, MSc, RD, CDE, CCN (U.S), PhD, is a Dietician at the Tamil Nadu Government Multi Super Specialty Hospital and serves as the Convenor of NetProFaN Chennai Chapter.	2024-06-07
10	Eating Healthy is a Balancing Act – Key Take- Aways from the Dietary Guidelines for Indians	Children and adults in our country suffer from deficiencies of several vitamins and minerals. They are simultaneously plagued by problems of excess. Obesity is on the rise along with problems of high blood pressure, elevated blood sugar and blood lipid levels. The new Dietary Guidelines are extremely helpful as they provide rich sources of each vitamin and mineral enabling better food selection. Healthy meal and snack ideas for different age groups have also been provided. Here are some key poin	<p>Recently, ICMR-NIN released the revised edition of the &lsquo;Dietary Guidelines for Indians&rsquo; which can help individuals and families understand how to eat healthy. They cover all life-stages, emphasizing health promotion and disease prevention. Unhealthy diets can lead to more than half (56.4%) of the total disease burden. Children and adults in our country suffer from deficiencies of several vitamins and minerals. They are simultaneously plagued by problems of excess. Obesity is on the rise along with problems of high blood pressure, elevated blood sugar and blood lipid levels. The new Dietary Guidelines are extremely helpful as they provide rich sources of each vitamin and mineral enabling better food selection. Healthy meal and snack ideas for different age groups have also been provided. Here are some key points from the guidelines which need to be highlighted.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFoods not only provide us with nutrients but also other bioactive substances which have a protective effect on health. The trick is to select the right kind of foods so that we get all the nutrients / other substances our bodies need to function optimally. No single food has miraculous properties to meet all the requirements of our body. We need to diversify our diet and eat at least 5-7 food groups each day, whilst being mindful that we eat a variety from each food group during a week. For fruits and vegetables, a good tracker for variety is to try and eat all colours in a week.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe guidelines divide the different foods into 10 groups &ndash; cereals and millets, pulses, vegetables, green leafy vegetables, roots and tubers, fruits, nuts, oilseeds and oils, milk, flesh foods, spices and herbs. The &lsquo;My Plate for the Day&rsquo; provides the proportion of each food group to be consumed in a day which is visually displayed as a thali (plate) and provides an approximate idea of quantity to consumers. For instance, all kinds of vegetables and fruits add up to occupy half of the plate which is roughly half a kg each day. Incidentally the list of vegetables does not include the all-time favourite potato because of its high carb content. Fresh whole fruits are promoted and not juices as the protective fibre is lost when we juice the fruit.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="Image 1" src="https://blogs.fssai.gov.in/img/image.png" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe Guidelines make a strong case for decreasing or altogether avoiding the consumption of foods high in fat, salt and sugar as well as ultra-processed foods, which are made with industrial ingredients and chemicals added to colour, flavour, and preserve the food. It is important to understand that these foods do not become healthier if they claim to have added vitamins, minerals and other desirable nutrients. How to read packaged food labels to be able to make healthier food choices has also been described in this freely downloadable document available on the website of the ICMR and National Institute of Nutrition (<a href="https://blogs.fssai.gov.in/(https://main.icmr.nic.in/sites/default/files/upload_documents/DGI_07th_May_2024_fin.pdf)">https://main.icmr.nic.in/sites/default/files/upload_documents/DGI_07th_May_2024_fin.pdf</a>)). In practice, it may not be possible to eliminate many of these foods completely from our diets, but we need to reduce the frequency and quantity of their consumption &ndash; something which is very well depicted in the &lsquo;Aaj se thoda kum&rsquo; campaign of FSSAI (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ue39uvSQI4s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ue39uvSQI4s</a>).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe guidelines also caution against consuming excess nutrients in the form of supplements, especially proteins, which are being consumed indiscriminately for building muscle mass. Any supplement intake should be prescribed and monitored by a certified health care professional. Along with what and how much to eat, guidelines encourage individuals to be physically active and exercise regularly to maintain good health. Keeping food safe and preventing nutrient losses while cooking is an important feature of the guidelines which everyone should go through. Safe food prevents foodborne illnesses. We may be selecting the right foods, but poor cooking practices may be leading to loss of important nutrients or production of harmful chemicals like for instance when we reuse frying oil. High heat and exposure to air results in toxic breakdown products in oil.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Guidelines on consumption of nutritious diets during sickness is especially crucial in the context of the tendency to dilute, withdraw and replace food for the sick with nutrient poor options. These guidelines are also designed to promote good health, prevent nutrient deficiencies, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases among the Indian population. It is essential to adapt these guidelines to individual needs and preferences while also considering cultural and regional food practices. The important thing to realise is that these practical tips need to be effectively communicated to the public and not just be restricted to the few who are able to consult qualified heath care professionals such as dieticians.</p>	blog_images/Eating_healthy.png	Prof. Pulkit Mathur	author_images/Prof._Pulkit_Mathur.jpeg	Prof. Pulkit Mathur is a faculty member in the Department of Food and Nutrition and Food Technology at Lady Irwin College, University of Delhi.	2024-08-01
